            <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>

            <p>This game was inspired by the classic Flash game <i>World's Hardest Game</i>. That game was deceptively
                simple—which
                was aimed to mimic. You simply navigate the square character to the endzone and collect all the coins
                without touching the circles. However, the game’s proportions made each level difficult due to speed,
                size,
                and direction of the obstacles. We aimed to copy this idea but add another challenge: movement
                manipulation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our game requires the player to move the player sprite, a potato in the shape of a circle, through the
                level
                and grab all the collectibles and reach the flag without hitting any of the saws, spikes or other
                obstacles.
                The twist in our game is that each collectible slows the player down by a percentage amount. This means
                that
                players must not only dodge the obstacles skillfully, they must also decide which order to attain the
                collectibles within the level. For example, if there are two collectibles, one in the middle of multiple
                obstacles and another in the open, we want the player to realize that the open one is a free
                collectible. It
                is meant to be collected after the collectible in the middle. This is because the collectible in the
                middle
                can only be collected if the player is moving fast. If they collect the free collectible, the player may
                be
                too slow to navigate through the obstacles and collect that second collectible.
            </p>

            <p>
                By employing this movement manipulation, we were able to challenge the player in multiple categories:
                skill,
                patience, persistence, and strategy. Skill of the game is required to beat all the levels—there is no
                avoiding that. Patience is tested on levels that have small gaps of escape and the player must wait to
                have
                those gaps open for them. Persistence is also tested in our game as users will fail on levels multiple
                times
                and will keep trying. Strategy is tested via the speed manipulation of the collectibles, as previously
                mentioned, and its impact on the players route through the levels.
            </p>

            <p>
                We aimed at creating a simple yet addictive game that players will try to beat in one sitting. This is
                achieved by orienting the game as a simple game that looks easy. Once the player starts playing the game
                and
                failing the levels, they motivate themselves that they ‘barely failed’. These small excuses keep the
                player
                challenged and now they feel the need to beat that level. Once they beat the level they were stuck on,
                the
                new level provides a surprise that jogs their curiosity—and they want to beat this level too. This cycle
                repeats per level until they have eventually beaten all levels.
            </p>

            <p>
                We did not gear this game to be a specimen that the player returns to after completing all levels—as
                there is
                going to be no change in the content when they come back. However, to accomplish that, we can add
                leaderboards per level that show the minimum deaths and time of all tries that occurred on that level.
                This
                can be a source of entertainment among the players and result in all of them coming back to beat each
                other’s scores.
            </p>

            <p>
                In conclusion, we had intended on creating a game based on the classic flash game <i>World's Hardest
                    Game</i> with a
                twist in speed manipulation. This game is intended to be deceptively simple, and addictive and we
                believe we
                managed to achieve those goals. We can further enhance our game with leaderboards for least deaths and
                time
                per level to drive a competitive aspect in our game.
            </p>
